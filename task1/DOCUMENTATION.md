step - two ---- my thought processs

When researching different methods from different websites i selected a hybrid method taking the best practices and develop combined approach to solve the problem  
1, case insensetive and counter
2, regex cleaning
3, handle longest words
4, error handling method and code efficiency

alternatives i used from them
-->Manually counting characters inside a loop
--->Using dictionary only for frequency
--->Splitting without cleaning punctuation
